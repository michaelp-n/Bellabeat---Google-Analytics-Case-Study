# Google Analytics Case Study - Introduction/Background Thoughts
_Michael Pon - September 2024_
## Background
### What is this?
This repository contains the script I independently created with R on R Studio to complete the Google Analytics Certificate Case Study.

### Why did I set out to tackle this?
I set out to complete the Google Analytics Case Study to confirm my knowledge of the fundamentals of "analytics" during my time as a data analyst.
While nearing the end of the course - I opted to complete the pre-prepared Bellabeat case study. 
The course presented three general pathways to completion; Microsoft Excel, SQL via BigQuery, and R. I've spent a fair amount of time dabbling with Microsoft Excel,
SQL, Tableau, Powerpoint, etc. to work with, transform, visualize, and present data previously. 

This time I opted to **work with R** in an effort to not show mastery but 
prove to myself (and anyone else interested!) that I could develop a basic proficiency with a variety of tools for the purpose of analytics. 

### What's in the R script?
There are about 500 lines of code in the R script. It includes the process of me loading the provided data from my selected working directory.
Transforming the data, and completing some visualizations. You will also find my general commentary on trends and thoughts on the data.

I truthfully wasn't so interested in the case study question as I was with dabbling with R. I transformed and visualized the data using the tidyverse packages, lubridate, dplyr, and reshape.

### Want to run this code yourself? 
I used R studio to load, transform, visualize the data. I will be including the data in my repository, you can download the data, save in the folder of choice, and revise the setwd() function to otherwise use my script as it's exactly coded.
